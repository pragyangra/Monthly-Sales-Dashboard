# Monthly-Sales-Dashboard

- Here I am using the TechnoEdge Monthy Sales Data based on which I have created a dashboard. As we know Power BI can obtain data from many different sources. My folder contains data about the sales for different months. So, the first step is to merge the files into a single folder for analysis(column names should be exactly same, position doesn't matter).
- Then I did some modifications on the data using 'Power Query'.Power Query is a very powerful data cleaning software.
- I created the first visual chart which was a stacked column chart and it represented the sales for different sub categories.
- I created a pie chart representing the sales per region and a donut chart giving us the sales by segment. These charts are mostly recommended for data with only a few distinct values.
- It is important to know which chart would represent a data better. The sales for different sub categories is better represented using stacked bar chart,so I modified it to that and used a stacked column chart for sales per category data.
